## What I Learned
* **CSS Variables (`:root`):** How to define a global color palette and shadow system to keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
* **Flexbox Layouts:** Using `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column` to stack form elements neatly.
* **Interactive UI:** Implementing smooth hover effects using `transition`, `transform: translateY()`, and custom box-shadows.
* **Responsive Units:** Using `vh` (viewport height) and percentages to ensure the footer and images scale with the screen.
* **Centering:** Using the `margin: auto` technique for horizontal alignment of the main container.
